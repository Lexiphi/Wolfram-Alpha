# Wolfram-Alpha
Collection of tools for working with Wolfram alpha


Current tool:

<ul>
  <li> Wolfram-Alpha javascript bookmarklet
    <ul> To-do
      <li>Wrap the script in an anonymous function</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>



Basic instructions (until I have time to write them out in more detail)

<ol>
  <li>Copy the entire script and save it as a bookmark. </li>
  <li>Now, go to 
https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=DiscretePlot%5BTable%5BX~Binomial(j,+0.01),+P(X%3E%3Db),+%7Bb,+1,+5%7D%5D,+%7Bj,+1,+500%7D%5D </li>
  <li>Put your cursor in the top left of the graph and press the key w</li>
  <li>Put your curson in the bottom right of the graph and press the key s</li>
  <li>Now it should automatically show you the x value and the % at that x,y point.</li> 
  <li>If you change the query to something other than 500 make sure to use the width adjustment text field</li>
  <li>If you submit a new query you will have to resync the tool by pressing the button to do so.</li>
 </ol>
